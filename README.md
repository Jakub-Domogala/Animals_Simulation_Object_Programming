## Short Description
This project is a simulation of animals behavior when equipped with tiny genome and will to survive.

## Openning window

Openning window lets user set all variables of the animation

## Simulation window
Simulation window contains few main areas which are: Maps, Plots, Numeric statistics and Buttons.
One of the maps is so called open map what means that when animal reaches side of the map and keeps going it appears on the opposite direction of the map.
Second map is closed so animalls are stopped when trying to cross any of the sides

## Map
Map is made of simple grid of size defined by user in the openning window.
Map displays two types of objects: animals and plants. When map exceeds certain size animals and grass images are swapped with lower resolution versions
There are 2 biomes: Step and Jungle
They differ only with plants growing rate which are crucial for animals to stay alive.

## Animals
Animals are equipped with small genome which defies how likely they will go in certain direction (8 directions in total).
Each animals genome can be displayed after clicking on certain animal while simulation is stopped

## Summary
I consider this project as opportunity to learn basics of object oriented programming, but because it was the first of this type of my authorship it's not a secret it has many unoptimal solutions inside
